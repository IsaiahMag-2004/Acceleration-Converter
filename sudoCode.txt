Acceleration 0.01 sudo code

Create variable inital_velocity of type decimal with no value
Create variable final_velocity of type decilam with no value
Create variable change_in_time of type decimal with no vlaue
Create variable acceleration of type decimal with no value 
Create variable units of type String with no value






prompt the user "Enter the initial velocity" and assign it to intial_velocity
prompt the user "Enter the final velocity" and assign it to final_velocity
prompt the user "Enter the change in time" and assign it to change_in_time
prompt the user "Enter the final units of hte problem" and assign it to units


acceeration is the  value of final_velocity minus inital_velocity over change_in_time

print to the consol "The acceleration is " concatinate variable acceleration
